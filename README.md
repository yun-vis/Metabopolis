# Metabopolis

Metabopolis is a new layout algorithm for biological pathways, which has been developed by [Hsiang-Yun Wu][yw], [Martin Nöllenburg][mn], [Filipa Sousa][fs], and
[Ivan Viola][iv], in the group [Research Division of Computer Graphics][rdcg] at [TU Wien][tuwien] in Vienna, Austria. The c++ library was developed by Hsiang-Yun Wu.

## Installing

### Prerequisites

- [cmake 3.4+][cmake]
- [qt 5.8][qt5]
- [cplex 128][cplex]
- [hola][hola]
- [Boost Graph Library 1.58][boost]
- [cgal][cgal]
- [tinyxml][tinyxml]
- [sbml][sbml]

### Metabopolis

Clone the Metabopolis repository into a directory `METABOPOLIS`.

```
$ cd METABOPOLIS
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
```
### Tested environment

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Mac OS 10.12

## Using Metabopolis

```
$ ./metabopolis
```

Step 1:
  Select the target folder of a dataset by pressing button "Browse"
  Defined: User defined duplicated metabolites. Duplication of metabolites is defined from ~/Desktop/gitroot/tools/bionet/xml/metabolite_frequency.txt
  Threshold: User defined threshold for metabolites duplication

Step 2:
  Edit the relationship graph
  Delete an edge: Shift Key + Mouse Right Button on an Edge
  Add an edge: Shift Key + Mouse Left Button on one Node and the other
  Confirm button: Compute graph layout
  Adjust button: Adjust box size

Step 3:
  Compute button: Compute the orthogonal layout
  HOLA: human-like orthogonal layout
  yFiles: compact orthogonal algorithm from yFiles package

Step 4:
  Compute button: Compute the connectivity between nodes in different categories

Step 5:
  Interaction mode
  Local: Connection of metabolites in one category
  Global: Connection of metabolites in multiples categories
  Both: Both
  Bundled: Bundled edges
  Extended: Extended edges

Remarks:

  - After loading the file folder, press "Batch" to run the program with all default settings.
  - Press "Export" to export images, which will be stored at `METABOPOLIS/svg/`
